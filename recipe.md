* 4 tbsp tamari/soy sauce
* Juice of 1 lime
* Cherry tomatoes
* 1 pak choi
* 1.5 litres of water/veg stock

####*INSTRUCTIONS*
 
Peel and finely chop onions (_we used red simply for colour but regular onions work just as well_).
Heat pan on medium heat. Add 2 tbsp oil. Add chopped onion and stir occasionally cooking for about 5 minutes.
Finely chop the garlic and grate the ginger and add to pot.
Slice your sweet potato and carrot into medium size pieces and add to your pan along with 1 teaspoon of salt.
Add your four measured spices into the heated mixture and stir it around for 1-2 minutes.
Next up, the sauce. Pour one tin of coconut milk and one tin of chopped tomatoes into the pan, stir all the ingredients together and cook for 2 minutes.
Add in 1.5 litres of water/veg stock, 4tbsp of tamari (_or soy sauce_) and the juice of one lime to the dish.
Bring your pan to the boil and allow to simmer for 30-40 minutes, stirring every now and again until all the lentils are cooked.
Finally, to make this dish vibrant looking and to add even more nutritional value, chop one head of pak choi and add this, along with the whole cherry tomatoes, to your pot.
